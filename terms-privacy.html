      <p><strong>In App Purchases</strong>. From time to time, Geekstyr may offer products and services for purchase (“in app purchases”) through iTunes,Google Play or other application platforms authorized by Geekstyr (each, a“Software Store”). If you choose to make an in app purchase, you will be prompted to enter details for your account with your Software Store (“your IAPAccount”), and your IAP Account will be charged for the in app purchase in accordance with the terms disclosed to you at the time of purchase as well as the general terms for in app purchases that apply to your IAP Account. SomeSoftware Stores may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. If you purchase an auto-recurring periodic subscription through an in app purchase, your IAP Account will continue to be billed for the subscription until you cancel. After your initial subscription commitment period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically continue for an additional equivalent period, at the price you agreed to when subscribing. If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your IAP account and follow instructions to cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the Geekstyr application from your device. Deleting your account on Geekstyr or deleting the Geekstyr application from your device does not cancel your subscription; Geekstyr will retain all funds charged to your IAP Account until you cancel your subscription through your IAP Account.</p>
